<span class="markdown">### Motivation 
One of the main tasks of national intelligence agencies is to investigate and act against organizations or persons that could pose a threat to the national security \cite{millerNationalSecurityIntelligence2024}. 
However, fulfilling this task is not possible without compromising on the constitutional right to privacy of citizens.
Consequently, national intelligence agencies that aim to safeguard these constituational rights must operate within a strict legal framework, whose compliance to this framework is monitored by independent institutions.
The decision making must also adhere to internal policies \cite{claverDevilsAdvocacyDutch2021} and making sure everything is done according these policies requires an individual not involved with the original decision making to understand in which context the decision was made. 
Reconstructing this context is a labor intensive and error prone process, which limits the time analysts can spend on conducting their investigations. 

We argue that, instead of reconstructing the decision context post hoc, decisions and the information and considerations on which they are based can be captured directly, during the investigation of a case. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of data that is used within the domain of TI is too much too process manually and therefore, the automated filtering and reasoning capabilities of an OWL-based ontology could substantially improve the productivity of analysts in the TI domain.Traditional data-base solutions or log files would fall short in capturing the complex relationships between pieces of information involved in decision-making processes.    

### State-of-the-Art and Limitations
To the authors knowledge, no ontology designed to capture the decision process has been applied to the field of TI.
Some formalized vocabularies that capture a more general form of decision making do exist, ranging from conceptual cognitive models \cite{garykleinDataFrameTheory2007, kleinPlausibilityGapModel2021, endsleyTheorySituationalAwareness2000} and  descriptions of behavioral elements \cite{balesInteractionProcessAnalysis1950, schermulyDiscussionCodingSystem2012, kauffeldAdvancedInteractionAnalysis2018} to technical descriptions \cite{BPMN2013, zotero-6487} and formal ontologies \cite{guizzardiCoreOntologyDecision, carCaseBaseReasoning2018, kornyshovaDecisionMakingOntologyInformation2010}.
The conceptual cognitive models and descriptions of behavioral elements are not compatible with the RDF syntax, whereas the technical descriptions and formal ontologies assume that all decisions are based on a set of predefined and explicit decision criteria, generally focusing on minimizing costs and maximizing gains. 
The domain of TI is too complex to reduce to a balance between costs and benefits.
Additionally, these models overlook the critical role of sensemaking in the complex decision-making landscape of threat intelligence.
Before an analyst can make a decision on what to do, he or she needs to know which information can be trusted, and how it can be explained \cite{vangerwenKnowWhatYou2024}.

### Approach and Contributions
To cover these gaps, the Threat Intelligence Decision Ontology (TIDO) was developed, which is capable of supporting and structuring the decision-making process of analysts within the TI domain, while simultaneously building a decision trace that can be used for post analysis. 
The ontology was designed by using an adaptation of the Ontology 101 methodology \cite{noyOntologyDevelopment1012001} and largely follows the developmental process of the eProcurement ontology \cite{makxdekkersD0201Specification2017}. 
Due to the highly sensitive nature of threat intelligence information and processes, we derive use-cases from publicly available and validated descriptions of the threat intelligence workflow (a podcast about the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD)).
The validation of the TIDO ontology was done by the creation of a set of competency questions produced by expert decision makers from the Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD).
By doing so, we have created an ontology that can be used by threat intelligence experts to structure and capture their decision making processes. </span>
