<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
National intelligence agencies navigate the complex task of safeguarding national security within strict legal and policy frameworks. Reconstructing the context of investigative decisions for compliance checks is prone to errors and labour intensive. To address this, we propose capturing decision-making processes and their rationale directly using an OWL-based ontology. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional data management in handling the intricate relationships within threat intelligence (TI) decision-making. Existing decision ontologies often lack the nuance required for the complex and sensemaking-driven nature of TI. To fill this gap, we developed the Threat Intelligence Decision Ontology (TIDO). TIDO structures analysts' decision-making while building a decision trace for post-analysis. Developed using the Ontology 101 methodology and validated through competency questions from intelligence experts from the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), TIDO offers a novel solution for capturing and understanding decision processes within the sensitive domain of threat intelligence.</span>
